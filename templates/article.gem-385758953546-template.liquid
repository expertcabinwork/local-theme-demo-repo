It consists of the brain, spinal cord, and the various nerves that travel throughout our body. As you can probably imagine, the nervous system is vital to pretty much everything we do, hear, see, feel, and think about. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, the nervous system can experience a wide range of complications. Some of these complications will be present at birth, some will appear suddenly due to injury or trauma, and others will naturally occur as we age. Anyone that wants to live a long, healthy, and fulfilling life will need to prevent these problems with the nervous system. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the most common issues the nervous system will face are vascular disorders, mental health issues like depression, exposure to toxins, neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer’s, tumors, organ failure, and much more. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Folic acid is a vitamin that is commonly found to be deficient in patients experiencing issues with their nervous system. It has led researchers to marvel at what role this vitamin plays in the nervous system and why a majority of these patients are deficient. </span></p>
<br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is the Nervous System?</span></h2>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we can understand how folic acid interacts with the nervous system, we have to first understand what the nervous system is and what it does for the body. There’s a lot to discover, so we’ll touch base on all the major points. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nervous system consists of five main divisions -- the central nervous system (CNS), peripheral nervous system, somatic nervous system, autonomic nervous system, and enteric nervous system. Let’s take a closer look at these divisions:</span></p>
<br>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Central Nervous System -</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> consists of the brain and spinal cord, mainly responsible for processing information, memory, and body regulation. It also regulates language, expression, emotion, creativity, and personality.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Peripheral Nervous System - </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">consists of everything outside the brain and spinal cord, including the nerves, ganglia, and sensory receptors. The PNS is made up of the somatic and autonomic nervous system.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Somatic Nervous System -</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> consists of the voluntary efferent neurons that stimulate skeletal muscles in the body.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Autonomic Nervous System - </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">consists of involuntary efferent neurons that stimulate visceral muscle tissue, cardiac muscle tissue, and glandular tissue. </span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Enteric Nervous System - </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">this system is a division of the autonomic nervous system that controls and regulates the digestive system. </span>
</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each of the divisions listed above are working constantly throughout the day, even when you’re sleeping. While they each carry out a wide range of functions in the body, the nervous system as a whole will have three main responsibilities -- sensory input, information processing, and motor output.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s take a closer look at those three functions:</span></p>
<br>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Sensory Input -</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the nervous system is responsible for collecting information from the sensory receptors found throughout the body; it’ll control our sight, smell, taste, touch, and hearing.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Information Processing -</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> once the information is collected, it will be sent through the central nervous system and processed in the brain. This is where our thoughts are created and decisions are made. </span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Motor Output -</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> once our body processes the information, the nervous system will act as a messenger station by telling the rest of the body what to do. This is where actions and behavior are displayed.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can see, the nervous system plays a central role in just about everything we do and that’s why issues with it can have such a large effect on your life. First, we sense, then we process, then we act. </span></p>
<br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is Folic Acid?</span></h2>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Folic acid is one of the eight vitamins in the Vitamin B Complex. It’s commonly referred to as Vitamin B9, with folic acid being the synthetic form created by humans. Folic acid can be found fortified in some foods and in over-the-counter supplements. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We actually consume Vitamin B9 on a daily basis through our diet. The Vitamin B9 found naturally in food -- such as dark green leafy vegetables, broccoli, beans, citrus fruits, and eggs -- is called folate. We should be eating around 400mcg of folate per day. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we consume folic acid or folate, the body converts it to methylfolate before being utilized in the body. Most doctors will recommend getting Vitamin B9 as folate from food, rather than folic acid from supplements, largely because folic acid must go through a more difficult process before being converted to methylfolate. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From there, it will play a role in a wide range of processes and functions in the body. It’s essential to the methylation process, converts homocysteine to methionine in the blood, and helps with the production of red blood cells and DNA. </span></p>
<br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Folic Acid and the Brain</span></h2>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In regards to the brain, folic acid is vital to the growth and development -- especially during pregnancy and post-pregnancy. This is a large reason why pregnant women are urged by doctors to supplement with folic acid, in addition to the folate they should be receiving through their diet. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even as a child grows up, folic acid deficiency can lead to a variety of mental health issues, including depression, anxiety, bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, and other mood disorders. In fact, folic acid deficiencies have been linked to mild cognitive impairment and dementia in older patients. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to that, folic acid deficiency has been linked to epilepsy. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can see, a folic acid deficiency can affect you from the moment of conception to the moment you pass away. That’s why it’s extremely important to eat enough folate and supplement with methylfolate when needed. </span></p>
<br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Folic Acid and the Spinal Cord</span></h2>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much like folic acid in the brain, folic acid plays a large role in the spinal cord -- the second major part of the central nervous system. Most of its effects on the spinal cord will be in preventing birth defects in newborns. Again, this is why pregnant women and breastfeeding women are encouraged to increase their folic acid intake. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the major birth defects folic acid can help prevent is called spina bifida, which is when the spinal cord doesn’t develop properly. It’s one of the many neural tube defects linked to folic acid deficiency. Other types of neural tube defects are encephaloceles, hydranencephaly, iniencephaly, schizencephaly. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to preventing birth defects, folic acid has been shown to promote healing in spinal cord injuries. The folic acid will trigger a change in DNA, which leads to improved regrowth and methylation. This just adds to the astounding amount of evidence proving folate’s value inside the human body. </span></p>
<br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting Enough Folic Acid vs. Getting Too Much</span></h2>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve discussed how folic acid interacts with the human body and more specifically the nervous system. While it does plenty of good things for the body, problems start to occur when we get too much or too little. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The issues we discussed in the brain and spinal cord are generally due to a folic acid deficiency -- not getting enough of it -- but you might be wondering what happens when someone takes too much folic acid. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, we have to understand the difference between folate and folic acid in this situation. While we can eat all the folate we want without negative side effects occurring, we can’t say the same for folic acid. Too much folic acid will lead to unmetabolized folic acid building up in the blood. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you take too much folic acid, there’s a good chance that it disguises a Vitamin B12 deficiency and makes it difficult to detect. Since a Vitamin B12 deficiency can be just as alarming as a Vitamin B9 deficiency, this can become extremely dangerous when a Vitamin B12 deficiency is present. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to that, too much folic acid can lead to an increased risk of dementia, nerve damage, and age-related memory loss occurring much sooner than anticipated. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To combat this, it’s heavily recommended that we don’t consume more than 1,000mcg of folic acid per day. Likewise, doctors will usually suggest supplementing with methylfolate instead. </span></p>
<br>

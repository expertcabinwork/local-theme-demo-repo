<h3><span style="color: #32c11f; text-align: left;">Did you know that more than half of the world’s population has an MTHFR gene mutation?!</span></h3>
</div>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you’re visiting us, chances are you’ve heard of MTHFR. Perhaps you or someone you love has recently discovered that an MTHFR variant is responsible for many years of unexplained health issues.</p>
<p>We can’t all be scientists, and we don’t always have the time or energy to dive into the minutiae on every subject, including MTHFR.</p>
<strong>That’s where Methyl-Life™ comes in!</strong>
<p>We’ve done the research. We’ve read the books, talked to the doctors, and taken the deep dive. <strong>We’ve done it all so that we can deliver you the highest-quality supplements, but also so that we can share what we’ve learned and build a community around our shared health concerns and needs.</strong> </p>
<p>A few examples of informational topics we cover on our site are: MTHFR Symptoms, Treating MTHFR, MTHFR and Methylation and more ... But before we get to all that, let’s make sure we're on the same page…</p>
<h3><span style="color: #32c11f; text-align: left;">What is MTHFR, and what does it mean to have an MTHFR mutation or MTHFR deficiency?</span></h3>
<br>
<p>MTHFR stands for Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase. It is a key regulatory enzyme in the metabolism of folate. It also refers to a specific gene that plays a major role in the body’s methylation process. Both the enzyme and the gene have the same name, MTHFR. </p>
<p>However, when people talk about “MTHFR,” they’re usually not talking about either the enzyme or the gene, precisely. They are more typically referring to one of the two common MTHFR gene <u>mutations</u> or that causes the enzyme to become imperfect and much less effective in the body.</p>
<p>The gene’s role is very complex, and MTHFR gene polymorphisms (or variants) have been the focus of recent discoveries uncovered by the Human Genome Project. <strong>In fact, thanks to the Human Genome Project, we now know that there are as many as 60+ variants of the MTHFR gene! </strong>The two most well-known 677 &amp; 1298 were discovered in 1995 and 2001, respectively.</p>
<p>MTHFR SNPs (or Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) are often referred to as ‘mutations’ or ‘defects’ because of the problems they cause in the body. <strong>MTHFR most often refers to the two most well-known genetic SNPs (677 and 1298) that inhibit the ability of the body to methylate (or convert folate into L-5-Methyltetrahydrofolate - which the body requires for absorption and direct use). </strong>Instead, these mutations make imperfect folate coenzymes which don't work properly to generate all of the important downstream processes like: </p>
<ul>
<li>Synthesize DNA to regulate gene expression</li>
<li>Develop a healthy central nervous system</li>
<li>Promote balanced neurotransmitters like serotonin</li>
<li>Protect neurons by generating myelin</li>
<li>Regulate homocysteine levels for cardiovascular health</li>
<li>Produce glutathione for detoxification</li>
<li>Support healthy pregnancy and fetal development</li>
<li>And many more ...</li>
</ul>
<p>At the crux of it, <strong>the body has trouble converting folate from the food we eat into methylfolate (L-5-MTHF), the bioavailable folate enzyme needed to optimize health</strong>. The truth is our cells cannot actually use folic acid directly. Upon ingestion, folate <u>must</u> go through a 4-step process (called a metabolic pathway) in order to be converted into methylfolate, which is the “active” or usable form of folate that our body’s cells require.</p>
<p><strong>The MTHFR gene defect inhibits this metabolic pathway and prevents our cells from getting the methylfolate they need. </strong></p>
<p>Even though we know that there are more than 60 possible MTHFR gene mutations, most of the <strong>MTHFR Blood Tests</strong> used today only check for the two SNPs that are considered “common”: 677 and 1298.</p>
<p>Since we all get one copy of the MTHFR gene from each parent, a person could have many different combinations, as well as the problems that go with it. In fact, it’s very rare, but some folks can have <u>3</u> mutations (a double mutation on one gene and a single mutation on the other), or even <u>4</u> mutations in extraordinarily rare cases.</p>
